                    <p> I came from an Extended Family, I have an older brother, I was born on August 28, 2003 on Camagong Nasipit, ADN</p>
                    <br>My childhood is I just grew up at home with a comshop business which was run by my Grandparents on which I got addicted into and met many friends to play with and then there comes Kindergartern on which I met bunch of new people like Teachers,Pastors,Nuns.</br>
                    <br>On my Elementary Days I was following on my brother's footeps which is attending the same school as him on Northwestern Agusan Colleges it was a blast to met new people but of course my bestfriends on Kindergaten also went there which by fate led us to being classmates again it was fun growing up with them till Junior High well some of us got separated to other sections but we're still friends because of how close our bonds for many years there were things I first was amazed on how algebra was introduced to us and doing ComLab and SciLab Activities.</br>
                    <br> Then here comes my SHS Days My Parents said to move into the Neighbouring School NNVS on which my brother went in his entire Highschool Days, I have no choice but to do what they told me because I loved them so I went there it was the day of the Pandemic so my Grade 11 days was not so enjoyable due to the fact that it was just modules which was annoying to me.</br>
                    <br> But on my Grade 12 Days I was excited that the pandemic has calm down and we we're now allowed to go to school on our 2nd Sem sadly this happened after my Father died on 2021 so I wasn't really in the mood yet btw my course was ABM on which did not suprised me that there were only mostly girls on my classmates on which I was glad that there is another Male classmates to befriended with but what I didn't know is that he would only go to school 3 days a month or something geez so one thing led to another I was really forced to make friends with the girls until I friended them all they made my SHS experience a blast till graduation.</br>

                    <p>My First Hobby is Playing Games whether it is online or offline because I like tohave fun on my free time which I would chill and escaped reality for a bit.</p>
                    <br> Because on some of the games you can do impossible things in real life to be possible and let your imagination run wild with a lots of creativity or challenges that you can apply while playing to never get bored </br>
